# Creative Search Hotkeys

In a controversial move that made me irrationanably upset, Mojang removed the ability to swap items from the Creative Search Menu with your hotbar slots in 1.16pre5, due to the fact that some people can't move their mouse while typing. You can see one of the historic issue posts that caused this change [here](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-188655).

As a crusader for justice, a champion of the people, and someone who has already tried and failed to hotswap items in pre5 500 times, I knew I had no choice but to revert this change. That's why I created *Creative Search Hotkeys*.

This mod is available under the Fabric Loader on 1.16 pre5, and works client-only. You can see a preview of it [here](https://streamable.com/xffpjb) before fully deciding on downloading it. 

**FAQ**:

Q: Will this mod be available on prior versions? A: Fantastic question. I have no plans to port to prior versions at the moment due to a lack of manpower, but that stance may change in the future.

Q: Does hope really not exist? A: Another fantastic question. The only pinnacle of hope in this universe can currently be found on [issue 189102](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-189102), where a heroic user provides an [example of this issue](https://bugs.mojang.com/secure/attachment/308107/Minecraft%201.16%20Pre-release%205%20-%20Singleplayer%202020-06-12%2020-14-24_Trim.mp4) and asks why it was changed.
